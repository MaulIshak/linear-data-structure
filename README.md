## 🧱 Implemented ADTs

- **Linked List**
  - Core implementation `linked_list.c/.h`
  - `test_linked_list.c`: test functions
  - Case Studies

- **Stack**
  - Core implementation `stack.c/.h`
  - `test_stack.c`: test stack functionalities
  - Case Studies

- **Queue**
  - Core implementation `queue.c/.h`
  - `test_queue.c`: test queue functionalities
  - Case Studies

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

### 🔧 Compile
Make sure `make` and `gcc` are installed on your system.

In the terminal, run:

```bash
make
```

This will generate the following executables:

- `test_linked_list`
- `test_stack`
- `test_queue`

### 🚀 Run Programs

```bash
./test_linked_list
./test_stack
./test_queue
```

### 🧹 Clean Compiled Files

```bash
make clean
```

## 🎯 Goals

- Help beginners understand how Linear Data Structure work at a low level.
- Serve as a reference or template for academic or personal use.
- Provide real-world case studies for each data structure.

## ✍️ TODO / Progress

- [x] Linked List (80% done — basic functions & some case studies)
- [ ] Stack (not started yet)
- [ ] Queue (not started yet)
- [ ] Additional case studies for each DS (not started yet)
